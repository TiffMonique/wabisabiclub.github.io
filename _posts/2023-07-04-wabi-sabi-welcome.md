Welcome to the website of Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club, the home of an exciting initiative of micro communities dedicated to fostering game development as a powerful tool for social fun. We believe that games have the potential to create meaningful impact in society, and our mission is to bring together individuals who share this belief, enabling them to develop games together and use this as a tool for social change.

Our initiative is built upon the idea that collective action is more impactful than individual efforts. Our vision is to create a network of modular micro communities, each focused on its own specific needs to create spaces that are fun for everyone. These micro communities serve as hubs for passionate game developers and enthusiasts to collaborate, share knowledge, and create games just for fun or for a specific purpose.

This is an open source and open education initiative so if you want to support it and contribute to it you can find it on Github at https://github.com/WabiSabiClub/wabisabiclub.github.io
