## Why Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club was born

I created Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club as an open initiative to develop micro-communities dedicated to fostering game development as a powerful tool for social fun. As an independent video game developer based in a third-world country, I have been able to witness firsthand the needs arising from the lack of community initiatives that are open, fun, and designed to be really inclusive towards people with all levels of expertise and backgrounds. The primary goal of the Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club is to empower you to establish your own Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club. With the guide and tools provided on this platform, regardless of your experience or background, I believe that every video game enthusiast has the power in their hands to create a beautiful community in their immediate surroundings. The mission of this project is to bring together individuals who share the belief that collective and positive action around building games can be beneficial towards personal well being and the betterment of the communities around them.

I may be wrong but I believe that the true essence of game development lies in the process itself, rather than the final product so the philosophy of this project is embrace the art of imperfection and the beauty of impermanence as in the japanese teaching Wabi Sabi. This project aims to promote modularity and flexibility, ensuring that the knowledge shared on this platform can be easily adapted to various environments, particularly those in countries with specific needs. By prioritizing modularity, we seek to provide information and resources that can be customized and applied effectively in diverse contexts. Our goal is to empower individuals and communities by tailoring the knowledge to their specific requirements, ultimately fostering sustainable growth and development within each micro-community.

## Activities for your own Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club

These are some activities for which we will be sharing all the necessary materials and knowledge so that you can organize your own club. If you have any ideas that you would like to share yourself please feel free to contribute to this website.

1. Social Events and Meetups: Organize casual social events, both online and offline, to promote networking, build relationships, and foster a sense of camaraderie among members. This can include game nights, virtual hangouts, or local meetups for members to connect in person.

2. Game Jams: Organize regular game jam events where members can collaborate and create games within a specified time frame. Encourage participants to embrace imperfection and experiment with unconventional approaches to game design.

3. Workshops and Tutorials: Conduct workshops and tutorials on various aspects of game development, ranging from programming and art to storytelling and game design. Encourage experienced members to share their knowledge and mentor others, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth.

4. Feedback and Playtesting Sessions: Facilitate regular feedback and playtesting sessions where members can showcase their game projects and receive constructive feedback from the community. Encourage open discussions and provide a supportive environment for sharing ideas and improving game projects.

5. Developer Spotlights: Highlight the work of individual members or micro-communities within the club by featuring their games, projects, or achievements. This can inspire others, promote collaboration, and foster a sense of recognition within the community.

6. Collaborative Game Projects: Initiate collaborative game development projects where members can work together on a shared game concept. Encourage diverse skill sets and backgrounds to come together, creating an inclusive and collaborative environment.

7. Community Challenges: Organize creative challenges or competitions within the community, such as creating games with specific themes, limitations, or styles. These challenges can foster creativity, inspire innovation, and provide opportunities for members to connect and learn from one another.

10. Community Showcases and Exhibitions: Arrange opportunities for members to showcase their games or projects to a broader audience, such as participating in game expos, exhibitions, or organizing dedicated community showcases. This can provide exposure, feedback, and networking opportunities for members.

By actively engaging in these activities and initiatives, each Wabi Sabi Game Dev Club can cultivate a strong and supportive community, fostering collaboration, creativity, and personal growth among its members.
